# Estimation algorithm 

Model estimation is performed in three steps:

1. Estimation of the mean function $\mu(\cdot, \cdot)$ by employing a bivariate smoothing algorithm.
2. Estimation of the marginal covariance function, the eigencomponents $\{\lambda_k, \phi_k(\cdot)\}_{k\geq 1}$.
3. Estimation of the scores $\xi_{ik}(t_{ij})$ and smoothing to obtain estimates of the score functions $\xi_{ik}(t)$ at all points $t\in\mT$.

This repository provides a way to estimate the model in three steps.
